# TFitPiCAN_0.1.0
**Raspberry Pi CAN-Bus Simulator**

## Overview
TFitPiCAN is an educational tool designed to teach IT-Security professionals and automotive enthusiasts about CAN-Bus communication. It supports both simulated and real CAN-Bus hardware setups, making it ideal for workshop environments or self-guided exploration.

## Features (Planned & Current)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Observe live CAN message flow.
- **Message Injection**: Send custom CAN messages for testing or security research.
- **Scenarios**: Simulate common automotive events (e.g., car start, accident).
- **Updater/Loader**: Checks for new versions and dependencies automatically.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Raspberry Pi 5 (Ubuntu) and macOS.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.9+** (for now, adjust as needed).
- Raspberry Pi 5 with CAN shield or a compatible USB-CAN adapter on macOS.
- `python-can` library (for CAN interactions).
- (Additional requirements to be determined).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
